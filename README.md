# Workshops-and-meetup

## Discussion evenings
Discussion evenings are meant to have a topic that define a common interest to discuss doing the evening. It is meant to be loosely discussed in a social setting and as such there will be no further agenda or timeframe.

### Ideas for topics

* Version control

* Continous integration/deployment

* Code readability

* Business needs vs time for perfection and engineering

* Processes and management... Toyota Karta, Scrum, Kanban boards, Documentation, Team roles
